                <p>My family and I love French Madeleines; these little cakes are just enough goodness to be an afternoon delight, but not an over-the-top indulgence. For those of you that haven’t come across Madeleines before, they are little, buttery cakes that are traditionally shaped as elongated shells. Read the Culture Trip’s article A Brief History of the French Madeleines to learn more about Madeleines. </p>
                <p>As you have learned, Madeleines are typically baked in a specific type of tin, but if you don’t have a Madeleine tin or if you just want to do something different, you can make them in any shape that you choose. When I want to make some cakes that are slightly bigger than traditional Madeleines, I use a cupcake tin. But, when I want them to be recognized as Madeleines, I use a proper Madeleine baking tin. This is the Madeleine Tin that I use: it works well and is not too expensive.</p>
                <p>Now that you have the baking tray, let’s move on to the batter. You will find a lot of different recipes for Madeleines and some will claim to be done the french way. I think as long as you think they taste great, then that should be good enough--french or not! When creating my Madeleine recipe, I tried many different recipes that I found online, but I liked the Baker by Nature and Sally’s Baking Addiction the best.  Both of these recipes provide important tips and information about baking Madeleines.</p>
                <p>The recipe that I have written down below is for plain Madeleines. But, you can make them with other flavors, too. Besides these traditional Madeleines, I like to make orange-flavored Madeleines dipped in dark chocolate. To give the orange flavor, I add orange zest of one orange into the batter. I love this flavor combination and I think these Orange & Dark Chocolate Madeleines work as perfect festive treats at holiday parties. Also, I like to make raspberry Madeleines dipped in white chocolate. For these, I fill the baking tin with the batter as instructed below, then I place a raspberry on top of the batter for each Madeleine. While the Madeleines bake, the raspberries sink down in the cake. The White Chocolate & Raspberry Madeleines are sweeter because the raspberry adds sugar to the cake, which tends to be a crowd pleaser!</p>
                <p>Madeleines are made with butter, flour, vanilla, sugar, lemon zest, eggs, baking powder, and a bit of salt. To signify these cakes as Madeleines, they need to rise while baking to form around a “hump” on top. To get the hump, the batter must be chilled for three or more hours so that the batter properly expands when it hits the heat of the oven. </p>

                <h2> Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of cake flour</li>
                    <li> 1 ½ cups of sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
                    <li>4 eggs (room temperature)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla</li>
                    <li> Zest of 1 lemon</li>
                    <li>1 cup of butter (2 sticks)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put the butter into a microwaveable bowl, fully melt the butter, and set it aside. </li>
                    <li> In a bowl add the flour, salt, and baking powder; then, set this bowl aside. </li>
                    <li> In a separate bowl, add the sugar and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer until the mixture is thick and pale and forms “ribbons'' when the whisks are taken out of the batter. For me, this takes about 4 minutes. </li>
                    <li> Add the vanilla and lemon zest into the egg/ sugar mixture. </li>
                    <li> With a spoon slowly combine the flour mixture into the egg/ sugar mixture. </li>
                    <li>With the flour and egg/sugar batter is combined, slowly drizzle the butter into the batter while mixing the batter on high with an electric mixer. Stop mixing once the ingredients are fully incorporated. The batter should look like a thick cake batter. </li>
                    <li> Cover the batter bowl and put it in the fridge for 3 hours or longer. The batter is good for up to 2 days in the fridge. Often, I make the batter the night before, so it has about 7 or 8 hours in the fridge.</li>
                    <li>After the batter rests in the fridge, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. *If you are using a cupcake tin, preheat to 375 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Butter the pan and coat the pan with flour. </li>
                    <li>Once the oven is heated, add a scoop of batter into each mold. I use roughly a tablespoon of batter for each cake. *For the cupcake tin, I double the batter allotment for each cake. </li>
                    <li> Bake for 10 minutes. *Note: baking time will differ depending on your oven, size of cakes, and the baking tin that you are using. For the cupcake tins, I baked them for 12-14 minutes, but for madeleines tin, I baked for 10 minutes. It's important to keep a watchful eye while baking. Once the sides turn a light brown, they are done.</li>
                    <li>Take the cakes out and rest them on a cooling tray, but do not dump the cakes on their tops because their humps will be marked and flattened. Instead, take each one out of the tin and place them on their bottom. </li>
                    <li>Let cakes fully cool.</li>
