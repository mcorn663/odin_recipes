                <p>A warm, soft & chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie is divine! These are the type of Chocolate Chip Cookies that I grew up eating and, to me, they are true comfort foods. The recipe that I use, I found on the bag of Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips; and, it is so good that I don’t have the need to look for a recipe. The Trader Joe’s recipe is simple and I have made my own modifications and details which allows me to bake perfect cookies on every batch!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 ¼ cups of flour</li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup of brown sugar firmly packed</li>
                    <li>½ cup of sugar</li>
                    <li>2 sticks of butter room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoon of Vanilla Extract</li>
                    <li> 2 eggs room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 pack of Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Add flour, salt, baking soda into a bowl and set aside. </li>
                    <li>Add brown sugar, sugar, and butter into a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. This takes me about 3 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Add eggs and vanilla and mix again until the mixture is light and fluffy again. </li>
                    <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the sugar/butter mixture. With a spoon slowly stir in the dry mixture until it is fully combined. I add a third of the mixture at a time until it is combined; and then, I do a quick mix of the batter with the electric mixer. </li>
                    <li>Add the Chocolate Chips and mix until they are incorporated into the batter. </li>
                    <li>Chill the batter for at least 3 hours. </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>Put a sheet of parchment paper or silicone baking mat on the baking sheet.</li>
                    <li> Scoop batter into even balls of batter and place on the baking sheet. I use a spoon to scoop my batter, but you can use a batter scoop. Here is a good article about batter scoops and the size of cookies by the Bakers Brigade.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 14 minutes. </li>
                    <li> Take out of the oven, let cookies sit on the tray for one minute, and then cool the cookies on the cooling tray. </li>
                    <li>Bake for 14 minutes. *Timing is determined by size of batter scoops, oven's cooking time, the temperature of batter.</li>
                </ol>
