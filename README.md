Odin Recipes
This is a project that I did as an assignment from The Oden Project. 
For this project, I used html and css to complete the assignment objectives. 

To make the best possible user experience:
  1. the formatting was kept clean and organized,
  2. the color scheme and fonts were carefully chosen,
  3. the layout was planned and flexbox was implemented,
  4. and, the design included for computers and mobile devices. 

I hope you enjoy looking at these web pages; and, I hope you enjoy the recipes, too!
